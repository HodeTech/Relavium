# Commit Style

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-06-03
- **Related**: [code-review.md](code-review.md), [project-structure.md](../project-structure.md), [documentation-style.md](documentation-style.md)

Relavium uses **Conventional Commits**. Commits are part of the durable, auditable record
(the same value the [git-native workflows](architectural-principles.md#5-git-native-version-controllable-workflows)
principle places on the YAML files), so a commit message explains *what changed and why*,
scoped to the package it touched.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body — what and why, wrapped ~72 cols>

Refs: ADR-XXXX

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

- The **summary** is imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period, ≤ ~72 chars
  ("add fallback-chain runner", not "Added the fallback chain runner.").
- The **body** is optional for trivial changes, expected for anything non-obvious; it
  explains the reasoning, not a restatement of the diff.

## Types

`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`. A
**breaking change** appends `!` after the scope (`feat(core)!: …`) and explains the break
in the body under a `BREAKING CHANGE:` line.

## Scope per package

The scope is the package or app the change lives in, using the short workspace name (see
[project-structure.md](../project-structure.md)):

`llm`, `core`, `shared`, `db`, `ui`, `cli`, `desktop`, `vscode`, `api`, `portal`, `docs`,
`repo` (root tooling / config).

- One scope per commit; a change spanning packages is usually two commits. If genuinely
  atomic, pick the primary scope and name the rest in the body.
- Adapter-level work names the layer in the summary, not a vendor scope
  (`feat(llm): add anthropic streaming adapter`).

## Reference ADRs

When a commit implements or changes a decision, reference the ADR so history links back to
the reasoning:

- `Refs: ADR-0011` in a trailer (or inline in the body) for the decision a change
  implements.
- A commit that supersedes a decision says so and names the new ADR; it never silently
  contradicts an [Accepted ADR](../decisions/README.md) (that needs an ADR, per
  [architectural-principles.md](architectural-principles.md)).

## Co-Authored-By trailer

This is the **canonical home** for the AI co-author trailer; the skills
([standards-check](../../.claude/skills/standards-check/SKILL.md),
[commit-and-pr](../../.claude/skills/commit-and-pr/SKILL.md)) cite this rule rather
than redefine it. A commit produced with AI assistance ends with a `Co-Authored-By`
trailer on the last line:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Either form is accepted: the bare `Claude`, or the model-versioned `Claude Opus 4.x`
(e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`) that some tooling
emits. The email is always `<noreply@anthropic.com>`. Conformance checks match the
trailer loosely (`Co-Authored-By: Claude.*<noreply@anthropic.com>`) so either form
passes.

## Examples

```
feat(llm): add OpenAI-compatible adapter shared by openai + deepseek

Single adapter over the OpenAI Chat Completions wire format; DeepSeek
selected via custom baseURL. No vendor type crosses the @relavium/llm
seam. Streaming tool-arg fragments are reassembled at tool_call_end.

```
fix(core): classify provider 429 as retryable in fallback runner

A rate-limited attempt now advances to the next provider in the chain
instead of failing the run, and the failed attempt's usage is still
recorded so cost stays accurate across failover.

```
docs(standards): index the seven new engineering standards
```

## Rules

- Don't bundle unrelated changes; don't commit generated/formatting churn with logic.
- Commit messages are English, like all [docs](documentation-style.md#10-dates-and-language).
- Use the canonical event/term vocabulary in messages too (`cost:updated`,
  `sequenceNumber`), never the legacy dotted names.
