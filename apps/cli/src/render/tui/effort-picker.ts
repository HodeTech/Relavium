 * The standalone `/effort` overlay ([ADR-0066](../../../../../docs/decisions/0066-normalized-reasoning-effort-control.md) §6)
 * — a keyboard-owning submode (like the `/models` picker + the `/` palette) that lists the reasoning-effort tiers and,
 * on Enter, pushes the chosen tier as the session's per-turn override via the surface's effort setter (NO reseat —
 * effort changes neither provider, pricing, nor the plan).
 *
 * The rows come from the CATALOG, per model ([ADR-0071](../../../../../docs/decisions/0071-models-dev-as-the-model-metadata-source.md) §6)
 * — it used to be a fixed five-row list, and that was the bug: `gpt-5-pro` accepts exactly one of them.
 * It still needs no port and no async load; the catalog is a synchronous embedded snapshot.
 *
 * Two surfaces route the SAME fold (standalone `relavium chat` + the in-Home live chat); the accept is UNIFORM (call
 * `onSetEffort` + note), so — unlike the model picker's surface-divergent reseat-vs-default-write accept — no
 * per-surface branching lives here. Offered only when the model has a tier to offer; a model with none never opens
 * this overlay (the surface shows {@link effortUnavailableNote} instead). The pure fold + state live here; the ink
 * view is the shared {@link effort-tier-list.tsx} `EffortTierList`.
